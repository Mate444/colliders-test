# Small environment for testing Unity Colliders

## How to use

Although the camera is clunky you can use WASD to move your character<br>
and mouse movement to rotate it

## What can you do

### Change the size of the player
If the player cross the portal, the player will reduce it's size, and if you cross it again<br>
then it will be restored to it's previous size.<br>

### Teleport the player to a random location

If the player attaches to the golden wall for 2 seconds, he will be teleported<br>
to a random location between the platform. <br>

## A very simple exercise to practice how colliders work in unity, hope you enjoy it!
